# Employment-and-Education

This study investigates the link between education and employment in England. It is based on one dataset that ranks the 32,844 Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in England by deprivation, where the LSOA (1500 residents) with a rank of 1 is the most deprived.
This study considers two questions: does deprivation of education correlate with the deprivation of employment and if so, is this correlation as strong in the cities as in the rural areas?

# Background

Research in the past has been clear: more education leads to better prospects for employment (UK Government, 2014). This investigation uses the English Deprivation Indices to see if we can confirm this strong link between education and employment.
A downside of this dataset is that the choice of components and the weighting of those components that leads to the ranking is unavoidably subjective.

# Sources of data

The deprivation data used in this report was originally obtained from the Gov.uk website (Department for Communities and Local Government, 2015). The original Excel-file was converted into a CSV file and underwent some minor cleaning before it was imported as a data frame into Jupyter Notebook using Python.
